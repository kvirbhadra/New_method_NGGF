##Readme

Contains working code for the facility paper on an improved amplicon sequencing method using N(0-10) spacer-linked primers which doesn't need any PhiX spike-in.

All sequence data have been uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject number PRJNA866667.

We would also like to thank DADA2 creators for providing such a comprehensive tutorial upon which we build the analysis part of this project.
